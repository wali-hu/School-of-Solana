# My Rust Learning Journey

I have been learning Rust through the School of Solana Season 6 and have explored various topics. Below is a list of the key concepts I've learned so far:

- **Mutable and Immutable Variables**  
- **Tuples**
- **Arrays**
- **String Slicing**
- **Accessing the Value of String from `&str`**
- **Accessing the Value of `&str` from `String` (using `to_string`)**
- **Accessing the Value of `&str` from `String` (using `String::from`)**
- **Concatenation of String and `&str`**
- **Borrowing a Part of String using `&str[start..end]`**

## Control Flow:
- **if-else**
- **loop**
- **while**
- **for**
- **match**

I'm continuing my journey of mastering Rust and building projects with it. Stay tuned for more updates!
